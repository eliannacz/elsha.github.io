Once you've found the FooSales plugin, you can view details about it such as release information, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".= Manual installation =The manual installation method involves downloading the FooSales plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).= Updating =Automatic updates should work seamlessly, but as always though, please ensure that you back-up your website just in case.If for some reason you encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update, you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'Save'. That should revert things back to normal.== Frequently Asked Questions === How much does FooSales cost? =The basic version of FooSales is free.
